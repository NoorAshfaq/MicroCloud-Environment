My first goal is to create a functioning MicroCloud cluster that utilizes MicroCeph, MicroOVN, and LXDs. This is the bare minimum and I plan to expand from here. This is the second attempt at setting up MicroCloud. There were too many variables that I either skipped over, did not document, or think of in my first attempt. I’m sure this won’t be the last attempt either and with each attempt comes a greater understanding. As of now, I need to focus on getting MicroCloud up.

I currently have my main pc (using VirtualBox Ubuntu 24.04 VM) and 2 old laptops (bare metal Ubuntu 24.04) that I will be referring to as Laptop #1 and Laptop #2 throughout this process. As of now Laptop #1 has openssh installed but Laptop #2 does not.  I’m going to be accessing these laptops from my main pc.

The first thing I always like to do whenever I log into my machines, is to do sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y so I’m going to run this on all of my machines. 

Now I want to install openssh on Laptop #2 and I’m going to use the commands below:
sudo apt install -y openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
I have previously created a SSH key and copied it to Laptop #1 so I don’t have to input the password each time I SSH into it. I’m going to do the same for Laptop #2. This can be done by using the following command:
ssh-copy-id noor@10.0.0.167
 As of now, I can ssh into both of my old laptops from my main pc to avoid having to use them directly. 

The next step is to start on MicroCloud. As I mentioned before, my setup consists of my main pc and 2 old laptops. I want each laptop to be one node and my main pc to have an LXD VM of a node as well. 

Last thing for today, I created a repo on GitHub that I will update with my progress and so I have a public version for my resume.
